        <h1>This page knows your window size</h1>
        <p>Open dev tools (F12) and look at the console or network tab. You should see two images that failed to load. These represent the height and width of your screen.</p>
        <p>If this site was really tracking you there would be a server that would serve up 1px images and log the filename of the requests to track your window size.</p>
